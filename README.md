Spotify Clone

This project is a simplified clone of Spotify built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to simulate a music player interface, allowing users to play, pause, skip, and seek through songs.

With a clean and responsive design inspired by Spotify's UI, this project offers an interactive experience for playing music and managing playback.
